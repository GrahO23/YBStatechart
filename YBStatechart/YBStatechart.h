	Statecharts are represented using instances of YBStatechart.
    For more information on statecharts, see David Harel's white paper from 1986:
    http://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~harel/SCANNED.PAPERS/Statecharts.pdf
 
    A statechart object contains one rootState, which acts as an encapsulation for other substates (which can in turn have other substates
    as well). A YBStatechart instance plays the central role of activating a particular state and ensuring the appropriate sibling-,
    sub- and super- states get activated and deactivated.
 
    Another important role is the dispatch of events, @see -dispatchEvent:
    When an unknown selector (with no arguments) gets sent to a statechart, it will use the selector name and use that as an event to
    dispatch it to the states in the chart. Because of this behaviour, statechart objects can be used conveniently in combination with
    target-selector style objects (e.g. UIButton).
